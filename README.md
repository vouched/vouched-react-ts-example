# Vouched JS Plugin React + TypeScript Example

This code example shows how to add the Vouched JS Plugin to a React app. It was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) using `npx create-react-app <app-name> --template typescript` but will also work for projects created with `npx create-react-app <app-name>`. There are 2 main files, `src/vouched-script.js` for loading our script, and `src/App.tsx` for our React component.

## Getting it Running

Fill in `appId` in `src/vouched-script.js` with your Public Key. To obtain one, create a [Vouched account](https://www.vouched.id/get-started/) and generate a key from your [Vouched dashboard](https://docs.vouched.id/docs/manage-keys).

Next, run `npm install`, followed by `npm start`. You can inspect the console to see provided messages as you progress through the verification process.
